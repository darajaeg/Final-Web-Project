Restaurants, grocery stores, and food factories are the biggest contributors to food waste since these institutions 
discard food usually because it is not “good enough” to display. According to an article found on The Guardian, 
Americans throw away almost as much food as they eat because of a “cult of perfection” This insinuates the
idea that Americans have become conditioned and have adjusted to a certain format of what food should look like.

Most food is discarded if it looks unpleasant and not look picture perfect despite being <span>perfectly edible</span>. Generally, 
Manufacturers are the first ones responsible for food waste as they are the first to come in contact with food 
products. Restaurants produce more food than they sell and contribute to about 40% of Americas food waste. People 
in management positions do this to prevent reaching a deficit in business, to safeguard their rate of foot-fall.

On average, about 64% of restaurants do not donate food because there are “barriers.” Two examples would fall on 
the case of liability, although the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act of 1996 protects food donors of any
prosecution. Another apparent barrier is that some claim they should have a license and don’t want to go through
that extra step. This leaves only 22% of the restaurants in the U.S that disregarded these unofficial barriers and 
donate food anyway.</p>
